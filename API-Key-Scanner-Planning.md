## Security Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Defensive Security Focus**: Identify potential credential exposures to help developers secure their applications
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Scan all discoverable pages of a website for various types of sensitive credentials
- **Educational Value**: Provide clear guidance on remediation and security best practices
- **Minimal False Positives**: Use context-aware detection to reduce noise and focus on genuine risks

### Compliance and Standards
- Supports OWASP Top 10 security practices
- Aligns with security frameworks for credential management
- Provides audit trail for security assessments
- Helps identify violations of least-privilege principles

## Technical Architecture

### Integration Pattern
The API Key Scanner follows the existing three-phase orchestrator pattern:

**Phase 1: Data Discovery**
- Leverages existing site crawling to discover all pages
- No additional configuration required for URL discovery

**Phase 2: Page Analysis** 
- Scans each discovered page for API keys and tokens
- Executes in parallel with other page-level tests (SEO, accessibility)
- Collects findings across all pages for consolidation

**Phase 3: Report Generation**
- Generates consolidated security report with all findings
- Provides risk-based prioritization and remediation guidance

### Class Structure
```typescript
APIKeyTester
â”œâ”€â”€ scanPageForAPIKeys() - Individual page scanning
â”œâ”€â”€ performScan() - Content extraction and pattern matching
â”œâ”€â”€ generateConsolidatedReport() - Unified security report
â””â”€â”€ Support methods for pattern matching and risk assessment
```

## Detection Methodology

### Multi-Source Scanning
The scanner examines multiple sources within each web page:

1. **DOM Text Content**: All visible text content on the page
2. **JavaScript Code**: Inline scripts and external script content
3. **CSS Styles**: Style blocks that might contain configuration
4. **HTML Attributes**: Data attributes and configuration values
5. **Browser Storage**: Local storage and session storage contents

### Pattern-Based Detection
Uses regular expressions to identify known API key formats:
- **Exact Patterns**: Specific formats like AWS keys, Google API keys
- **Generic Patterns**: High-entropy strings that might be credentials
- **Context-Aware**: Keywords that suggest credential usage nearby

### Risk Assessment Algorithm
```
Base Risk = Pattern-specific risk level (High/Medium/Low)
Context Analysis = Presence of credential-related keywords
False Positive Check = Known placeholder and example patterns
Final Risk = Adjusted based on context and false positive likelihood
```

## API Key Patterns

### High-Risk Patterns (Immediate Action Required)

#### AWS Credentials
```regex
Access Key ID: AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}
Secret Key: [A-Za-z0-9/+=]{40}
```
**Risk**: Full programmatic access to AWS services
**Impact**: Data breaches, service disruption, financial loss

#### Google API Keys
```regex
Pattern: AIza[0-9A-Za-z\\-_]{35}
```
**Risk**: Access to Google Cloud services
**Impact**: Quota abuse, data access, service costs

#### GitHub Tokens
```regex
Personal Access: ghp_[0-9a-zA-Z]{36}
OAuth Token: gho_[0-9a-zA-Z]{36}
```
**Risk**: Repository access, code theft
**Impact**: IP theft, malicious commits, data exposure

#### Stripe Keys
```regex
Live Secret: sk_live_[0-9a-zA-Z]{24}
Live Publishable: pk_live_[0-9a-zA-Z]{24}
```
**Risk**: Payment processing access
**Impact**: Financial fraud, customer data breach

#### OpenAI API Keys
```regex
Pattern: sk-[a-zA-Z0-9]{48}
```
**Risk**: AI service access and quota abuse
**Impact**: Service costs, prompt injection attacks

### Medium-Risk Patterns (Review Required)

#### JWT Tokens
```regex
Pattern: ey[A-Za-z0-9_-]*\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]*\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]*
```
**Risk**: Session hijacking, privilege escalation
**Impact**: Unauthorized access, data exposure

#### Slack Tokens
```regex
Bot Token: xoxb-[0-9]{11}-[0-9]{11}-[0-9a-zA-Z]{24}
```
**Risk**: Workspace access, data extraction
**Impact**: Communication monitoring, data theft

#### Test Environment Keys
- Stripe test keys: `sk_test_*`, `pk_test_*`
- Development environment tokens

### Low-Risk Patterns (Manual Verification)

#### Generic High-Entropy Strings
```regex
Pattern: [a-zA-Z0-9]{32,}
```
**Risk**: Potential undocumented API keys
**Impact**: Varies based on actual service

## Implementation Details

### Page Content Extraction
```typescript
const pageContent = await page.evaluate(() => ({
  bodyText: document.body?.textContent || '',
  scripts: Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('script'))
    .map(script => script.textContent || ''),
  styles: Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('style'))
    .map(style => style.textContent || ''),
  attributes: Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('*'))
    .flatMap(el => Array.from(el.attributes)
    .map(attr => `${attr.name}="${attr.value}"`)),
  localStorage: /* Local storage contents */,
  sessionStorage: /* Session storage contents */
}));
```

### Context Analysis Keywords
```typescript
const CONTEXT_KEYWORDS = [
  'api', 'key', 'secret', 'token', 'auth', 'password', 
  'credential', 'access', 'private', 'config', 'env', 
  'bearer', 'authorization'
];
```

### False Positive Filtering
```typescript
const KNOWN_FALSE_POSITIVES = [
  'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
  'your-api-key-here',
  'sk-1234567890abcdef',
  'AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE',
  'example', 'placeholder', 'demo', 'test123'
];
```

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Levels

**ðŸ”´ High Risk**
- Known API key patterns with high confidence
- Production environment indicators
- Financial or data access implications
- Requires immediate action

**ðŸŸ¡ Medium Risk**  
- Likely credentials requiring manual review
- Test environment keys
- Session tokens and JWTs
- Should be investigated promptly

**ðŸ”µ Low Risk**
- Generic patterns requiring verification
- Development/example contexts
- Partial or masked values
- Review when convenient

### Risk Escalation Factors
- **Production Context**: Keywords like "prod", "live", "production"
- **Sensitive Services**: Financial, healthcare, authentication services  
- **High Entropy**: Long, random-looking strings
- **Credential Context**: Found near credential-related keywords

## False Positive Management

### Common False Positives

1. **Documentation Examples**
   - Tutorial code with placeholder keys
   - API documentation with example tokens
   - Configuration templates

2. **Test/Development Data**
   - Unit test fixtures
   - Development environment configurations
   - Sample data in demos

3. **Encoded Content**
   - Base64 encoded images or data
   - Hashed values that match patterns
   - Compressed or minified content

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Pattern Refinement**: Continuously improve regex patterns based on findings
2. **Context Analysis**: Check surrounding text for indication of real vs. example usage
3. **Whitelist System**: Allow users to mark known false positives
4. **Length Filtering**: Exclude very short matches for generic patterns
5. **Content Analysis**: Skip obvious placeholder values and examples

## Reporting and Remediation

### Report Structure

The consolidated security report includes:

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Total findings and risk breakdown
   - Pages scanned summary
   - Critical action items

2. **Risk-Based Findings**
   - Grouped by High/Medium/Low risk
   - Detailed context and location
   - Specific remediation steps

3. **Remediation Guide**
   - Immediate actions for high-risk findings
   - General security best practices
   - Implementation recommendations

4. **Educational Resources**
   - Links to security best practices
   - Tool recommendations

### Remediation Priorities

**Immediate (High Risk)**
1. Revoke and rotate exposed production keys
2. Audit access logs for suspicious activity
3. Remove keys from client-side code

## Conclusion

The API Key Scanner represents a significant enhancement to the Playwright Site Scanner's security testing capabilities. By combining comprehensive pattern matching with contextual analysis and risk-based reporting, it provides developers and security teams with a powerful tool for identifying and remediating credential exposures.

The implementation follows security best practices, maintains user privacy, and provides clear guidance for remediation. The modular design allows for future enhancements while maintaining compatibility with the existing testing framework.

This defensive security tool contributes to the overall goal of making web applications more secure by identifying vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors.
